1. Sally’s Ice Cream wasn’t in Rockland. Sherry didn’t get peppermint stick
ice cream on Thursday night.

2. Sherry stopped at the ice cream stand in Granite on the day before she
got the chocolate chip ice cream and the day after she stopped at Gary’s
Ice Cream.

3. At Tom’s Ice Cream she got peanut butter ice cream but not on Tuesday.

4. She got coffeebean icecream on Wednesday, but not at Alice’s IceCream.

5. She stopped at the stand in Marsh the day before she stopped at Sally’s
Ice Cream.

6. The ice she got in Boulder was gorgeous as well...
